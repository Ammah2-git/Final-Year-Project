This project builds on the official ROBOTIS OpenManipulator repositories and packages. We acknowledge and thank ROBOTIS for their open-source contributions, which serve as the foundation for this work:

open_manipulator_perceptions (https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/open_manipulator_perceptions)
→ Provides AR marker detection and perception integration in ROS.

open_manipulator (https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/open_manipulator)
→ Includes the controller, hardware interface, and motion logic for OpenManipulator-X.

These repositories are licensed under open-source terms by ROBOTIS. This project was developed for academic and educational purposes by extending their functionality.


# Final-Year Project: Autonomous Pick-and-Place System Using OpenManipulator-X

This repository contains the source code, libraries, configuration files, and documentation for the development of a real-time autonomous robotic sorting system using the OpenManipulator-X robotic arm and ROS Noetic. The project was implemented for a Final Year Project in the Mechatronics Engineering program at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).

## 📌 Project Overview

The system is capable of detecting objects tagged with AR markers using a USB camera and the `ar_track_alvar` ROS package. The OpenManipulator-X robotic arm then picks and places these objects into designated locations based on the marker ID. This is achieved using real-time image processing, coordinate transformation, and inverse kinematics implemented within the ROS framework.

## 🚀 How to Launch the System

Open the following terminals in sequence to launch the full pipeline:

**Terminal 1: Start the ROS Master**
```bash
roscore
```

**Terminal 2: Launch OpenManipulator Controller**
```bash
roslaunch open_manipulator_controller open_manipulator_controller.launch usb_port:=/dev/ttyACM0 baud_rate:=1000000
```

**Terminal 3: Start AR Marker Detection**
```bash
roslaunch open_manipulator_ar_markers ar_pose.launch
```

**Terminal 4: Start the Pick-and-Place Node**
```bash
roslaunch open_manipulator_pick_and_place open_manipulator_pick_and_place.launch
```

> Ensure that the camera is positioned overhead, the markers are printed and visible, and the workspace is well-lit and planar.
